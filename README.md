# Diabetes_Prediction_LassoReg
Predicting the person had diabetes or not by Lasso Regression Model.

Depending upon the varous factors such as age, sex, bmi, bp etc. the model predict weather the person had diabetes or not.

Projects steps:

1)Downloaded a load_diabetes data set from dataset module of sklearn library. This dataset contains various features which can help our model for accurate prediction.

2)Identified the most relevant data and target features to improve the predictive power of the model.

3)Developed and trained predictive models using Lasso Regression technique.

4)Built a web app of that model using flask framework and deploy the model into production environment with the help of ngrok host platform.
